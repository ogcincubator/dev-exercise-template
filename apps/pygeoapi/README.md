# pygeoapi

This repository contains the necessary files to standup an implementation of pygeoapi and publish the data on the [data](./data) folder.

[pygeoapi](https://pygeoapi.io/) is a Python server implementation of the OGC API suite of standards. It is a Reference Implementation for OGC API - Features, OGC API - Tiles and OGC API - Environmental Data Retrieval, and compliance certified for OGC API - Processes.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## About the Data

On the [data](./data) folder you will find an tinydb database containing daily means of water level or flow. The daily mean is the average of all unit values for a given day. This dataset is provided by the [National Hydrological Service (NHS) of Canada](https://wateroffice.ec.gc.ca/).
