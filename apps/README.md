# README Apps ðŸ‘‹
This folder contains the Module 3 assignment, which can be done using an OGC API implementation.

The goal is to publish a vector dataset as OGC API - Features (OAF), and to run the [compliance tests](https://github.com/OSGeo/cite-runner) to validate the results.

* If you would like to run the Module 3 assignment and publish data using OAF, please go to [README-publishers.md](./README-publishers.mdREADME-publishers.md).
* If you would like to add support to another implementation of OAF please go to [README-implementers.md](./README-implementers.md).
