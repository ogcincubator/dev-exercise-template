Clone your repository. For instance if your username were `foo` and your repo were named `data-publisher`, you would clone it in the command line interface with:

git clone https://github.com/foo/data-publisher.git
```

Then go inside that repository. The rest of the exercise will be done there.

```bash
cd data-publisher
```
